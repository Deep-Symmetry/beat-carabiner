## [Unreleased][unreleased]

Nothing so far.

## [0.1.2] - 2019-10-31

### Fixed

- Release 0.1.1 was not actually tested, and there were some changes
  to the Beat Link API which caused it to crash. Even though this is
  an interim release until Open Beat Control is ready (and people are
  ready to move to it), I want people to be able to take advantage of
  the fixes in Beat Link.

## 0.1.1 - 2019-10-25

### Fixed

- Incorporates a much newer version of beat-link which has many
  important fixes. This is expected to be the final release of this
  project as a standalone executable; those features are moving to the
  planned open-beat-control project, which will add many more too.

## 0.1.0 - 2017-03-20

### Added

- Intitial Release.
