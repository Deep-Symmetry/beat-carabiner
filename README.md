# beat-carabiner

A minimal tempo bridge between Pioneer Pro DJ Link and Ableton Link.

As suggested by [marek-memsql](https://github.com/marek-memsql), this
is a minimal headless implementation of just enough features from
[beat-link-trigger](https://github.com/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger#beat-link-trigger)
to enable tempo and beat synchronization between a Pioneer Pro DJ Link
session and an Ableton Link session. It is designed for headless,
unattended operation so that it can be run on hardware like the
Raspberry Pi.
