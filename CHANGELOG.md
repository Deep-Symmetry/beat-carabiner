## [Unreleased][unreleased]

### Fixed

- Incorporates a newer version of beat-link which is more resilient
  about device number conflict-avoidance when running for a long time
  and repeatedly attached to different Pro DJ Link networks. (This is
  unlikely to be a problem anyway, since it only uses device numbers
  from 5 to 15, but just to be safe...)

## 0.1.0 - 2017-03-20

### Added

- Intitial Release.
