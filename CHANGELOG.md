## [Unreleased][unreleased]

Nothing so far.

## [0.1.1] - 2019-10-25

### Fixed

- Incorporates a much newer version of beat-link which has many
  important fixes. This is expected to be the final release of this
  project as a standalone executable; those features are moving to the
  planned open-beat-control project, which will add many more too.

## 0.1.0 - 2017-03-20

### Added

- Intitial Release.
